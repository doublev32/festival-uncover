# Festival Uncover

## The goal

This project has for goal to make people discover new artists that will be playing at different festivals.

In order to do so, the user will be presented with a list of festival for the current or past years. Each festival will contain a line up of artist and the website will present to the user each artist with their top songs. The user will also be able to see each artist informations such as their music genre, the day they will be playing, the stage and many other different tags.

The user will be able to search for their favorite genre, tag or stage to find artists that correspond the best to what they look for.
